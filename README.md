# Flutter-starter
Flutter first app: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first

## Nlutter Experience & Notes
* It tried to create its own root. I'll let it be for now.

### Widgets
"Widget" ~= Component

#### Rendering
   * Widgets call `build` to render/re-render
   * `build` returns widget(s) (one widget, or a nested tree of widgets)

### State
  * `BuildContext` inst. declares state
  * context.`watch<StaneName>` declares state reliance
